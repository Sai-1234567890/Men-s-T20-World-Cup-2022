Hello Connections!

Just wrapped up an exciting project diving deep into the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022 using Python, Pandas, Excel, and Power BI. We aimed to identify the world's best 11 players by categorizing them into roles such as openers, middle order, lower order, finishers, and fast bowling specialists.

Project Objective:

To find the world's best 11 players in the T20 2022 World Cup, segmented by key roles. The players were selected based on several performance parameters like batting averages, strike rates, and bowling economy, ensuring a balanced team capable of both scoring 180+ runs and defending a score of 150.

Steps in this Project:

Extracted data through online APIs.
Cleaned and processed the data using Jupyter Python.
Prepared and structured the data into a CSV file (Excel).
Imported the data into Power BI for analysis.
Performed data processing and DAX calculations.
Created insightful dashboards to visualize player performance.
Power BI dashboards provided real-time insights into the best-performing players.
Exported and shared the final project.
Tools Used:

Data Extraction & Cleaning: Python, Pandas
Data Visualization & Analysis: Power BI
Database: Excel

T20 World Cup 2022 Dashboard using Power BI:

• Developed an interactive dashboard using player and match data from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2022. • Streamlined data processing & analysis to evaluate player performance based on key metrics like batting average, strike rate, and bowling economy. • Shared actionable insights with stakeholders, highlighting the best 11 players across different roles (openers, middle order, finishers, and fast bowlers), supporting decision-making in team selection.

Based on the provided statistics, the team shows impressive performance both in batting and bowling:

Batting Avg: 39.60
Strike Rate: 154.54
Average Balls Faced: 19.71
These suggest the team has a solid ability to score runs at a quick pace, supporting the goal of achieving 180+ runs on average.

On the bowling side:

Bowling Avg: 14.12 (Runs conceded per wicket)
Bowling Strike Rate: 13.09 (Balls bowled per wicket)
Economy: 6.47 (Runs allowed per over)
Dot Ball %: 41.15% (Percentage of dot balls bowled)
These metrics indicate the team is strong at restricting runs, with a low economy rate and the ability to take wickets quickly. This makes defending a target of 150 runs very achievable.

Final Conclusion:
The team is well-rounded, with strong batting capable of consistently scoring over 180 runs.
The bowling unit is efficient enough to defend a score of 150, keeping the opposition under pressure with dot balls and regular wickets.
This team composition should meet the objectives of being competitive both while setting and defending targets.
